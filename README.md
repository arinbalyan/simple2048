# Project Brief: 2048 Game

## 1. Goals

- Create a fully playable 2048 game.
- Implement smooth animations for tile movements and merges.
- Ensure the game is responsive and playable on different screen sizes.
- Adhere to modern UI/UX principles for a clean and intuitive interface.

## 2. Feature List

- Standard 2048 game mechanics:
    - 4x4 grid.
    - Tiles with powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, ..., 2048).
    - Arrow key controls (Up, Down, Left, Right) for moving tiles.
    - Tiles slide and merge when moved.
    - New tiles (2 or 4) appear randomly on an empty spot after each move.
- Game Over detection (no more possible moves).
- Score tracking.
- Smooth animations for tile sliding and merging.
- Responsive design.
- (Optional) Reset game button.
- (Optional) Touch controls for mobile devices.

## 3. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Styling:** Plain CSS (possibly with CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout and transitions/animations for effects).
- **JavaScript:** Vanilla JavaScript for game logic and DOM manipulation.

## 4. Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Initial Setup):** Basic HTML structure, CSS for grid and tiles, initial game logic (grid generation, new tile spawning).
- **Phase 2 (Core Mechanics):** Implement tile movement and merging logic for all four directions.
- **Phase 3 (Animations & UI):** Add smooth CSS animations for tile movements. Implement score tracking and game over detection.
- **Phase 4 (Refinement):** Responsive design adjustments, code cleanup, bug fixing, and optional features (reset button, touch controls).

## 5. Key Design Considerations

- **UI/UX:**
    - Clear visual distinction between tiles.
    - Intuitive feedback for player actions.
    - Visually appealing animations that don't hinder gameplay.
- **Performance:**
    - Efficient DOM manipulation to avoid lag, especially during animations.
    - Optimized game logic for quick move calculations.
- **Maintainability:**
    - Modular JavaScript code (e.g., separate functions for movement, merging, UI updates).
    - Well-commented CSS and JavaScript.
